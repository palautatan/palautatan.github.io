# Mabuhay!
That means "welcome!" in Tagalog. And since we're translating, *palautatan* is how you say "statistics".

My name is Edie Espejo. I am a Cal 2020 master's graduate. I specialize in **data science** (statistics, machine learning, and functional programming). I am experienced with bioinformatics and customer analytics.
