# Mabuhay!
That means "welcome!" in Tagalog. And since we're translating, *palautatan* is how you say "statistics". My name is Edie Espejo, and here are some of my selected work samples. My favorite statistical applications are business, basketball, and biotech.

## Personal Projects
* Warriors Basketball Analyses (Soon to be posted...)
* <a href="https://palautatan.github.io/fight/01-map/yelp-api.html">Northern Californian Martial Arts Map</a>

## Gene Expression Signatures of Endometriosis

Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent condition that affects nearly 10% women of reproductive age and is characterized by chronic pain and inflammation. In this genomics project, our team explored and evaluated machine learning models on their ability to identify subjects with endometriosis based on gene expression intensity alone.
