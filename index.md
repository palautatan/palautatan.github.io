## My Data Science Endeavors
Hi, my name is Edie. I enjoy boba, stress cleaning, and curating <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/edieaudio">Spotify playlists</a>. I almost have a BS in Statistics from UC Davis. Almost. My favorite thing in school and one of my favorite things to do for fun is Statistical Computing. Other than that, I adore Real Analysis and Biology. I am a proud, dedicated, and happy member of the <a href="http://phylolab.org">Moore Lab</a>. I also ran a Data Science convention called  <a href="http://www.iidata.net/">iidata</a>.

```python
# SHOUT OUTS TO BARNEY
song = "I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas!"
print(song)

vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
for vowel in vowels:
    verb = vowel + "te"
    fruit = "banan" + vowel + "s"
    print("I like to " + ("".join(verb)+", ")*2 + "".join(verb) + " apples and " + fruit + "!")

```
