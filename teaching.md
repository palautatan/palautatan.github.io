I have a passion for teaching numbers and hope to take my experience further someday.

___

# University
At Cal, I taught <a href='../ph142'>PH142</a>, Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Public Health and Biology. I also taught **STAT2**, Introduction to Statistics. Teaching these courses will forever be a highlight of my life.

# High School
**AP Statistics** is offered through most high schools. I started tutoring AP Stat through Zoom in 2020. My experience in teaching university-level statistics well placed me to tutor high school students in their AP statistics courses.

I am not currently taking any AP Statistics students. I will be taking students again starting in the next school year, 2021-2022.
